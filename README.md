House price prediction using Machine learning in Python 
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting house prices using Python. We utilize the Jupyter Notebook environment and a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to build and train a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on various features.
Project Overview
In this project, we delve into the field of machine learning to tackle the problem of predicting house prices. The goal is to explore a dataset from Kaggle and develop a robust model that can provide accurate predictions. The project is implemented using Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment.

Dataset
The dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains information about various features of houses along with their corresponding prices. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.
